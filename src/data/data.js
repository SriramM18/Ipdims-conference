    title:"About IPDIMS",
    content:"Product Design is the idea generation to commercialize the product by a systematic approach, conceptualize and evaluate ideas to create a product. The product designer’s role is to combine art, science, and technology to create new products that people can use. Their evolving role has been facilitated by digital tools that now allow designers to communicate, visualize, analyze and produce tangible ideas in a way that would have taken greater man power in the past. Smart Manufacturing is a broad category of manufacturing with the goal of optimizing concept generation, production, and product transaction. While manufacturing can be defined as the multi-phase process of creating a product out of raw materials, smart manufacturing is a subset that employs computer control and high levels of adaptability. Smart manufacturing aims to take advantage of advanced information and manufacturing technologies to enable flexibility in physical processes to address a dynamic and global market. The theme, IPDIMS discusses the current issues that are facing in industries. In this conference, a wide range of fields like Computer Science, Electronics, Electrical, Automation, Robotics, 3D Printing, Smart Manufacturing, Mechatronics, Composite Materials and many more likely to be covered in this conference. Experts from industries and academia deliver the keynote lecture at this conference."
